### NOTE: My tests accounted for all possible edge cases. Also, made sure that all tests are failing before actual implementation.

### To setup and run the project
```Clone the Project```
Install the jest framework for testing
```npm init```
```npm install --save-dev jest```

``To run all test cases: npm test``
